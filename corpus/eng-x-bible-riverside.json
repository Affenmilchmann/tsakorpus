    "41 006 040\tThey lay down in rows by hundreds and by fifties .",
    "41 006 041\tThen he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looked up to heaven and blessed them , and broke them and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people . The two fishes he also divided among all .",

    "43 019 031\tThe Jews , because it was Preparation Day , in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath , for that Sabbath was a great day , requested Pilate to have their legs broken to kill them .",

    "44 017 006\tNot finding them , they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the magistrates , shouting , \" These men who have upset the world have now come here .",
    "44 017 007\tJason has received them . They all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is a different king â Jesus . \"",
    "44 017 008\tBoth the crowd and the magistrates were disturbed on hearing this .",
    "44 017 009\tSo they took security from Jason and the rest and then dismissed them .",
    "44 017 010\tThe brethren immediately sent off Paul and Silas in the night to Beraea . They on arrival went into the synagogue of the Jews .",
    "44 017 011\tThese people were nobler than those in Thessalonica . They welcomed the message with all readiness and examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so .",
    "44 017 012\tConsequently many of them believed , and also not a few Greeks ; women of high standing and men .",
    "44 017 013\tWhen the Jews of Thessalonica learned that God's message had been proclaimed by Paul also in Beraea , they came there agitating and disturbing the crowds .",
    "44 017 014\tAt once then the brethren sent away Paul to go down to the sea coast . Silas and Timothy remained there .",
    "44 017 015\tThose who were conducting Paul took him as far as Athens , and , after receiving a letter to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible , they left .",
    "44 017 016\tWhile Paul was waiting for them in Athens , his spirit was stirred within him as he looked upon the city full of idols .",
    "44 017 017\tHe often debated in the synagogue with the Jews and pious persons , and in the market-place every day with whoever happened to be there .",
    "44 017 018\tSome of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him , and some said , \" What can this idle talker mean ? \" Others said , \" He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods , \" because he was telling the good news of Jesus and the resurrection .",
    "44 017 019\tThey took him and led him up on to the Areopagus , saying , \" May we know what this new doctrine that you are speaking of is ?",
    "44 017 020\tFor you are bringing strange and surprising things to our ears . We wish to know what these things are . \"",
    "44 017 021\tFor all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time in nothing else than in telling or hearing something newer than the last .",
    "44 017 022\tPaul took his stand in the midst of the Areopagus and said : \" Men of Athens , I see that you are in every way unusually reverential to the gods .",
    "44 017 023\tFor in passing about and contemplating your sacred objects I came upon an altar on which was inscribed , ' To an unknown God . ' What you are worshiping in ignorance â that I am making known to you .",
    "44 017 024\t\" The God who made the world and all the things that are in it , he who is Lord of heaven and earth , does not dwell in temples made by hands ,",
    "44 017 025\tnor is he served by human hands , as if he needed anything . For he gives to all life and breath and all things .",
    "44 017 026\tAnd he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth , having marked out the appointed times and the boundaries of their abodes ,",
    "44 017 027\tthat they might seek for God , if they could feel after him and find him , though , indeed , he is not far from each one of us .",
    "44 017 028\tFor in him we live and move and are ; as some of your own poets have said , ' For we also are his offspring . '",
    "44 017 029\tBeing then the offspring of God , we ought not to think that deity is like gold or silver or stone , a thing carved by man's art and thought .",
    "44 017 030\tThe times of ignorance God overlooked , but now he commands all men everywhere to change ,",
    "44 017 031\tsince he has set a day in which he will soon judge the world in justice by the man whom he has appointed , and of whom he has given evidence to all men by raising him from the dead . \"",
    "44 017 032\tWhen they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some sneered ; others said , \" We will hear you again about this . \"",
    "44 017 033\tSo Paul went out from the midst of them .",
    "44 017 034\tBut certain men attached themselves to him and believed . Among them was Dionysius the Areopagite , and there was a woman named Damaris and several other persons .",
    "44 018 001\tAFTER this Paul left Athens and came to Corinth .",
    "44 018 002\tThere he found a Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus but recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife , because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome . Paul visited these people ,",
    "44 018 003\tand because he was of the same trade stayed with them and they worked together ; for by trade they were tent-makers .",
    "44 018 004\tBut in the synagogue every Sabbath he reasoned and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks .",
    "44 018 005\tWhen Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia , Paul was absorbed by the message , bearing witness to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .",
    "44 018 006\tWhen they resisted and spoke profane words , he rent his garments and said to them , \" Your blood is on your own heads . I am clear , and from now on I am going to the Gentiles . \"",
    "44 018 007\tSo he changed over from there and came into the house of a man named Titus Justus , who reverenced God . His house was next to the synagogue .",
    "44 018 008\tCrispus , the synagogue Director , believed in the Lord with all his household , and many of the Corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized .",
    "44 018 009\tThe Lord spoke in the night by a vision to Paul , \" Do not fear , but speak and be not silent ,",
    "44 018 010\tfor I am with you and no one shall attack and harm you , for I have many people in this city . \"",
    "44 018 011\tSo he stayed a year and six months , teaching among them the message of God .",
    "44 018 012\tWhile Gallio was Proconsul of Achaia , the Jews with one mind made an attack on Paul and brought him before the court ,",
    "44 018 013\tsaying , \" This man is inducing men to worship God in a way contrary to law . \"",
    "44 018 014\tAs Paul was about to open his mouth , Gallio said to the Jews , \" If it was some crime or wicked knavery , O you Jews , I would have reasonable patience with you .",
    "44 018 015\tBut if it is a dispute about doctrine and names and your own law , see to it yourselves . I will not be a judge of these things , \"",
    "44 018 016\tand he drove them from before the judge's seat .",
    "44 018 017\tThen they laid hold of Sosthenes , the synagogue Director , and beat him right in front of the judge's seat . But Gallio cared for none of these things .",
    "44 018 018\tPaul remained a number of days more . Then after taking leave of the brethren he sailed away to Syria , and Priscilla and Aquila went with him . He had shaved his head at Cenchreae , for he had a vow .",
    "44 018 019\tThey came to Ephesus and Paul left his companions there . He himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jews .",
    "44 018 020\tAlthough they begged him to stay longer , he did not consent ,",
    "44 018 021\tbut took his leave , saying , \" I will return to you again , God willing . \"",
    "44 018 022\tFrom Ephesus he put to sea and came to Caesarea . Then he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church , and from there returned to Antioch .",
    "44 018 023\tAfter spending some time there he set out and went through the Galatian country and Phrygia , place by place , strengthening all the disciples .",
    "44 018 024\tA certain Jew named Apollos , an Alexandrian by birth , a learned man , had come to Ephesus .",
    "44 018 025\tHe was strong in knowledge of the Scriptures and had been instructed in the way of the Lord , and , being very earnest in spirit , was teaching accurately about Jesus , although he knew no baptism but John's .",
    "44 018 026\tThis man began to speak fearlessly in the synagogue . When Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately still .",
    "44 018 027\tAs he wished to cross over to Achaia , the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him . So he went and greatly helped those who had believed through grace .",
    "44 018 028\tFor he powerfully and publicly refuted the Jews , showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ .",
    "44 019 001\tWHILE Apollos was in Corinth , Paul , after passing through the upper country , came to Ephesus and found certain disciples .",
    "44 019 002\tHe said to them , \" Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? \" They said to him , \" On the contrary , we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit . \"",
    "44 019 003\tHe said , \" How then were you baptized ? \" They said , \" With John's baptism . \"",
    "44 019 004\tPaul said , \" John baptized with the baptism of a change of heart , telling the people to believe in one who was coming after him , that is , in Jesus . \"",
    "44 019 005\tOn hearing that , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus ,",
    "44 019 006\tand when Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied .",
    "44 019 007\tThere were about twelve of these men in all .",
    "44 019 008\tFor three months Paul went into the synagogue and spoke fearlessly , arguing persuasively regarding the kingdom of God .",
    "44 019 009\tWhen some were hardened and would not believe and spoke evil of the Way before the congregation , he departed from them and took away his disciples and discussed daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus .",
    "44 019 010\tThis went on for two years , so that all the inhabitants of Asia , both Jews and Greeks , heard the message of the Lord .",
    "44 019 011\tThrough the hands of Paul , God did miracles of no ordinary kind ,",
    "44 019 012\tso that handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick , and the diseases left them and the evil spirits departed .",
    "44 019 013\tThen some of the wandering Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , \" I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims . \"",
    "44 019 014\tThere were seven sons of a certain Sceva , a Jewish high priest , who did this .",
    "44 019 015\tBut the evil spirit answered them , \" Jesus I know and Paul I know ; but who are you ? \"",
    "44 019 016\tand the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on them and overpowered both of them , and so belabored them that they fled from that house naked and wounded .",
    "44 019 017\tThis became known to all who were living in Ephesus , both Jews and Greeks , and awe fell on all of them , and the name of the Lord Jesus came to be held in high honor .",
    "44 019 018\tMany of those who had become believers came confessing and telling of their practices .",
    "44 019 019\tA number of those who had practiced magic brought their books and burned them before all . Adding up the prices of them they found the total to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .",
    "44 019 020\tThus vigorously the Lord's message grew and strengthened .",
    "44 019 021\tWhen these things had been accomplished Paul took it in mind to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem , saying , \" After I have been there I must see Rome also . \"",
    "44 019 022\tHe sent on into Macedonia two of his assistants , Timothy and Erastus , but he himself remained awhile in Asia .",
    "44 019 023\tAt that time there arose no small commotion about the Way .",
    "44 019 024\tFor a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , a maker of silver shrines of Artemis , was bringing to the artisans no small gain .",
    "44 019 025\tHe gathered these and the workmen employed about such things and said , \" Men , you know that from this business we get our wealth ,",
    "44 019 026\tand you see and hear that not only at Ephesus , but also throughout almost all Asia this Paul has persuaded and drawn away a large number , saying that hand-made gods are not gods at all .",
    "44 019 027\tNot only is this trade of ours in danger of coming into disrepute , but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is in danger of being held of no account , and she whom now all Asia and the wide world worship will be deposed from her majesty . \"",
    "44 019 028\tUpon hearing this , they became full of anger and shouted , \" Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! \"",
    "44 019 029\tThe city was filled with confusion , and the people rushed with one mind into the theater , having gotten hold of Gaius and Aristarchus , fellow travelers of Paul's .",
    "44 019 030\tWhen Paul wished to go in and face the people the disciples would not let him .",
    "44 019 031\tSome of the city officials who were his friends sent to him and begged him not to expose himself in the theater .",
    "44 019 032\tSome were shouting one thing and some another , for the assembly was in confusion , and the most did not know why they had come together .",
    "44 019 033\tSome of the crowd fixed on Alexander , since the Jews were putting him forward . And Alexander motioned with his hand and wished to make a defense before the people .",
    "44 019 034\tBut when they recognized that he was a Jew , there arose one shout from all for about two hours , \" Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! \"",
    "44 019 035\tThen the City Clerk quieted the crowd and said , \" Men of Ephesus , who is there of all men who does not know that the city of Ephesus is the temple-keeper of the great Artemis , and of her image which fell down from Zeus ?",
    "44 019 036\tSince these things are indisputable , you ought to be calm and do nothing rash .",
    "44 019 037\tFor you have brought here these men who are not robbers of temples nor defamers of your goddess .",
    "44 019 038\tIf Demetrius and the artisans with him have a charge against any one , there are court days and there are proconsuls ; let the parties state their cases .",
    "44 019 039\tIf you are seeking anything further , it shall be settled in a lawful assembly .",
    "44 019 040\tFor we are in danger of being called in question regarding to-day's mob , and we shall not be able to give a reason for this tumult . \"",
    "44 019 041\tBy saying this he dissolved the gathering .",
    "44 020 001\tWHEN the uproar had ceased , Paul sent for the disciples , and , after encouraging them , he bade them farewell and left to proceed to Macedonia .",
    "44 020 002\tPassing through those parts and encouraging them by many addresses , he came into Greece .",
    "44 020 003\tThere he spent three months . When a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria , he decided to return through Macedonia .",
    "44 020 004\tThere were in company with him Sopater of Beraea , the son of Pyrrhus , and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus , and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy , and from Asia Tychicus and Trophimus .",
    "44 020 005\tThese went on and were waiting for us in Troas .",
    "44 020 006\tAfter the Days of Unleavened Bread we sailed from Philippi and came to them in Troas in five days . There we spent seven days .",
    "44 020 007\tOn the first day of the week , when we all were assembled to break bread , Paul was discoursing to them , being about to leave in the morning , and he extended his address until midnight .",
    "44 020 008\tThere were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled .",
    "44 020 009\tA certain young man named Eutychus , sitting in a window , was overcome with deep sleep while Paul went on discoursing . At last overpowered by sleep he fell from the third story and was taken up dead .",
    "44 020 010\tBut Paul went down and threw himself on him and embraced him and said , \" Do not make a noisy wailing ; for his life is still in him . \"",
    "44 020 011\tThen he went up and broke bread and ate and talked on till daybreak and so departed .",
    "44 020 012\tThey brought the boy living , and were not a little comforted .",
    "44 020 013\tWe went in advance to the ship and sailed for Assos , intending to take on Paul there , for so he had arranged , intending to come himself by land .",
    "44 020 014\tSo when he joined us at Assos , we took him aboard and came to Mitylene .",
    "44 020 015\tFrom there we sailed next day and arrived off Chios . The next day we came to Samos , and on the following day to Miletus .",
    "44 020 016\tFor Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus in order not to spend time in Asia . He was hurrying to be in Jerusalem , if possible , on the Day of Pentecost .",
    "44 020 017\tFrom Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church .",
    "44 020 018\tWhen they came to him , he said to them , \" You know how I have lived among you the whole time since the first day I set foot in Asia ,",
    "44 020 019\tserving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews â",
    "44 020 020\thow I did not shrink from telling you anything that was profitable or from teaching you publicly and from house to house ,",
    "44 020 021\turging upon both Jews and Greeks the need of a change of heart toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus .",
    "44 020 022\t\" And now I am on my way , bound in spirit , to Jerusalem , not knowing what is to befall me there ,",
    "44 020 023\texcept that the Holy Spirit testifies from city to city that chains and trials are waiting for me .",
    "44 020 024\tBut I do not hold my life as of any account if only I may finish my race and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus , to testify to the good news of the grace of God .",
    "44 020 025\tAnd now I know that you all , among whom I have gone about heralding the kingdom , will never see my face again .",
    "44 020 026\tTherefore I testify to you to-day that I am clear of the blood of all .",
    "44 020 027\tFor I did not shrink from telling you the whole purpose of God .",
    "44 020 028\t\" Be watchful of yourselves and of all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers . Shepherd the church of God which he bought with his own blood .",
    "44 020 029\tI know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you , not sparing the flock .",
    "44 020 030\tAnd from among yourselves men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves .",
    "44 020 031\tTherefore watch , remembering that for three years I never ceased night nor day to exhort each one of you with tears .",
    "44 020 032\t\" And now I commit you to the Lord and to his gracious message , which can build you up and give you the heritage among all those who have been made holy .",
    "44 020 033\tI have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel .",
    "44 020 034\tYou yourselves know that these hands provided for my needs and the needs of my companions .",
    "44 020 035\tIn all things I showed you that so laboring we ought to help the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , that he said , ' It is more blessed to give than to receive . '",
    "44 020 036\tAfter saying this he kneeled with them all and prayed .",
    "44 020 037\tAll wept aloud , and falling on Paul's neck they kissed him affectionately ,",
    "44 020 038\tgrieving especially because he had said that they would never see his face again ; and they escorted him to the ship .",
    "44 021 001\tWHEN we had torn ourselves away from them and had sailed , we made a straight run to Cos , then on the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara .",
    "44 021 002\tThere finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia we went on board and sailed .",
    "44 021 003\tAfter sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left , we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre ; for there the ship was to discharge her cargo .",
    "44 021 004\tWe looked up the disciples and stayed with them seven days . They repeatedly told Paul through the Holy Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem .",
    "44 021 005\tBut when we had finished the days , we left and continued our journey , and they all with their wives and children escorted us until we got outside of the city . Then , after kneeling down on the beach and praying ,",
    "44 021 006\twe tore ourselves from one another ; we went aboard the ship and they went back to their homes .",
    "44 021 007\tWe made the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais . There we greeted the brethren and remained one day with them .",
    "44 021 008\tOn the next day we left and came to Caesarea , and entered the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the Seven , and we stayed with him .",
    "44 021 009\tPhilip had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy .",
    "44 021 010\tDuring our stay of many days a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Jerusalem .",
    "44 021 011\tHe came to see us , and took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said , \" Thus says the Holy Spirit , ' So will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt , and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles . ' \"",
    "44 021 012\tWhen we heard this , both we and the residents there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem .",
    "44 021 013\tPaul answered , \" What are you accomplishing by weeping and breaking my heart ? For I hold myself ready not only to be bound , but to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . \"",
    "44 021 014\tWhen he would not be persuaded , we stopped talking , saying , \" The Lord's will be done . \"",
    "44 021 015\tAt the end of these days we packed up and went up to Jerusalem .",
    "44 021 016\tSome of the disciples from Caesarea went up with us , taking along Mnason , a Cypriote , an old-time disciple , whose guests we were to be .",
    "44 021 017\tWhen we reached Jerusalem , the brethren welcomed us cordially .",
    "44 021 018\tOn the next day , Paul went in with us for an interview with James , and all the elders came .",
    "44 021 019\tAfter saluting them , he related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his service .",
    "44 021 020\tAfter hearing him , they gave glory to God and said to Paul , \" You see , brother , how many tens of thousands of believers there are among the Jews , and they are all zealous for the Law .",

    "44 021 022\tWhat then ? It will be generally heard that you have come .",
    "44 021 023\tSo do this that we tell you . There are among us four men who are under a vow .",
    "44 021 024\tTake these men and go through purification with them and pay their expenses , so that they may shave their heads . Then all will know that what they have heard about you amounts to nothing , but that you yourself walk in obedience to the Law .",
    "44 021 025\t\" But as to the Gentiles that have believed , we have , after consideration , sent our decision that they shall guard themselves against what has been sacrificed to idols , and against blood , and against what has been strangled , and against unchastity . \"",
    "44 021 026\tThen Paul on the next day took the men , and , after purifying himself , entered the Temple courts , giving notice of the completion of the days of purification â the time until a sacrifice would have been offered for each one of them .",
    "44 021 027\tBut when the seven days were nearly completed , the Jews from Asia saw him in the Temple courts , and stirred up all the crowd and laid their hands on Paul ,",
    "44 021 028\tshouting , \" Men of Israel , help . This is the man who teaches everybody everywhere against our people and the Law and this place , and moreover , he has brought Greeks into the Temple courts and has desecrated this holy place . \"",

    "44 021 030\tThe whole city was excited and the people rushed together . Seizing Paul , they drew him out of the Temple courts , and immediately the gates were closed .",
    "44 021 031\tAs they were trying to kill him , word went up to the Tribune of the battalion that all Jerusalem was in commotion .",
    "44 021 032\tHe at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the people . They , on seeing the Tribune and the soldiers , stopped beating Paul .",
    "44 021 033\tThen the Tribune coming up arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains , and inquired who he was and what he had done .",
    "44 021 034\tSome called out one thing and some another in the crowd . Not being able to find out anything for certain on account of the confusion , he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks .",

    "44 022 002\tHearing him speaking to them in the Hebrew language , they kept all the more quiet . He continued :",

    "44 022 004\tI persecuted this Way to the death , binding and delivering into prison both men and women ,",
    "44 022 005\tas the High Priest and all the eldership can testify for me . From them I received letters to the brethren and was journeying to Damascus in order to bring back in chains to Jerusalem for punishment those who had gone there .",
    "44 022 006\tIt happened that as I was journeying and nearing Damascus , about noon , suddenly a great light flashed from heaven around me .",
    "44 022 007\tI fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? '",
    "44 022 008\tI asked , ' Who is speaking ? ' He said to me , ' I am Jesus the Nazarene , whom you are persecuting . '",
    "44 022 009\tMy companions saw the light , but did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me .",
    "44 022 010\tI said , ' What shall I do , Lord ? ' The Lord said to me , ' Rise and go into Damascus , and there you will be told about all that it has been appointed for you to do . '",
    "44 022 011\tSince I could not see , owing to the brightness of that light , my companions led me by the hand , and so I entered Damascus .",
    "44 022 012\t\" Then a man named Ananias , a strict observer of the Law and highly esteemed by all the Jews who lived there ,",
    "44 022 013\tcame to see me and stood by me and said , ' Brother Saul , receive your sight , ' and I , at that moment , could see him .",
    "44 022 014\tHe said , ' The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will , and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth ,",

    "44 022 021\tBut he said to me , ' Go , for I will send you far away to Gentiles . '",
    "44 022 022\tThey listened up to this point , but now they broke out , shouting , \" Away with such a fellow from the earth ! He ought never to have lived ! \"",
    "44 022 023\tWhile they were shouting and rending their garments and throwing dust into the air ,",
    "44 022 024\tthe Tribune ordered him to be led into the barracks and directed that he should be examined with the lash , so that he might know for what crime they were shouting so against him .",
    "44 022 025\tWhen they had tied him up with the thongs , Paul said to the Centurion who was standing by , \" Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman , and without a trial ? \"",
    "44 022 026\tOn hearing that , the Centurion went to the Tribune and told him , \" What are you going to do ? For this man is a Roman . \"",
    "44 022 027\tThen the Tribune came to him and said , \" Tell me ; are you a Roman ? \" He said , \" Yes . \"",

    "44 023 004\tThose who stood by said , \" Are you insulting God's High Priest ? \"",

    "44 023 006\tThen Paul , perceiving that one party was of Sadducees and the other of Pharisees , shouted out in the Council , \" Brethren , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees . I am being tried for the hope of the resurrection of the dead . \"",
    "44 023 007\tOn his saying this , a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees , and the assembly became divided .",
    "44 023 008\tFor the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor any angel or spirit , but the Pharisees confess both .",
    "44 023 009\tSo a great uproar arose , and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose and contended , saying , \" We find nothing wrong in this man . What if a spirit has spoken to him , or an angel ? \"",
    "44 023 010\tWhen the strife was becoming violent , the Tribune , fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them , ordered the soldiers to go down and take him from the midst of them and bring him into the barracks .",

    "44 023 012\tWhen it was day , the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul .",
    "44 023 013\tThere were more than forty who had taken this oath .",
    "44 023 014\tThey came to the high priests and elders and said , \" We have bound ourselves by an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .",
    "44 023 015\tNow therefore you and the Council must ask the Tribune to bring him down to you , as if you were going to inquire more exactly about him , and we , before he comes near , will be ready to put him out of the way . \"",
    "44 023 016\tBut the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush , and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul .",

    "44 023 018\tHe took him and led him to the Tribune and said , \" Paul , the prisoner , called me and asked me to bring this young man to you . He has something to say to you . \"",
    "44 023 019\tThe Tribune took him by the hand and led him aside and asked , \" What is it that you have to tell me ? \"",

    "44 023 022\tThe Tribune dismissed the young man after charging him ; \" Tell no one that you have revealed this to me . \"",
    "44 023 023\tThen calling to him two of the centurions he said , \" Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea , and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen , at nine o'clock to-night . \"",

    "44 023 033\tThe horsemen came on to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor , and also placed Paul before him .",
    "44 023 034\tHe read the letter and asked of what province he was , and learned that he was from Cilicia .",
    "44 023 035\tThen he said , \" I will hear what you have to say when your accusers also arrive . \" He gave orders that Paul should be guarded in Herod's castle .",
    "44 024 001\tAFTER five days the High Priest Ananias came down with certain elders and an advocate named Tertullus , and they spoke against Paul to the Governor .",

    "44 025 008\twhile Paul claimed in his own defense , \" Neither against the Jewish Law nor against the Temple courts nor against Caesar , have I committed any wrong . \"",
    "44 025 009\tFestus , wishing to gain favor with the Jews , asked Paul , \" Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried for this before me ? \"",

    "44 025 014\tAs they were spending a good many days there , Festus laid Paul's case before the King . \" There is a man here , \" he said , \" who was left a prisoner by Felix ,",

    "44 025 016\tI answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any person for punishment before the accused has his accusers face to face and has opportunity for defense against the charge .",
    "44 025 017\t\" So they came along down here and , without making any delay , on the very next day I took my seat on the judge's bench and ordered the man to be brought in .",
    "44 025 018\tWhen his accusers arose , they brought no charge of such crimes as I was expecting ,",
    "44 025 019\tbut they had some disputes with him about their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died and whom Paul affirmed to be alive .",
    "44 025 020\tBeing at a loss about a question of this kind , I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on the charges .",

    "44 027 029\tThen fearing that they might run into rocky places , they cast out four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come .",

    "44 027 035\tSaying this he took a loaf and gave thanks to God before all and broke it and began to eat .",

    "44 028 007\tIn the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the Governor of the island , whose name was Publius . He welcomed us and for three days hospitably entertained us .",
    "44 028 008\tIt happened that the father of Publius was lying ill with fever and dysentery . Paul went in to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him .",

    "45 005 012\tTherefore as through one man sin entered the world , and through sin death entered , and so death spread to all men , since all sinned â",
    "45 005 013\tfor down to the time of the Law sin was in the world , and yet sin is not charged where there is no law ;",
    "45 005 014\tbut death reigned from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned like Adam , who is the type of him who was coming .",
    "45 005 015\tBut the gracious gift is not like the fall . For if by the fall of the one the many sinned , much more did the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many .",
    "45 005 016\tAnd the free gift was not like the sentence that came through one who sinned ; for the sentence came from one fall for condemnation , but the free gift was that men should be called righteous in spite of many falls .",
    "45 005 017\tFor if by the fall of one man death reigned through that one , much more those who receive the abounding grace and the free gift of righteousness will reign in life through one , that is , through Jesus Christ .",
    "45 005 018\tAs then through one fall sentence came upon all men and they were condemned ; so through one righteous act the free gift came to all men so that they are pronounced righteous and live .",
    "45 005 019\tFor as by the disobedience of the one man the many were set down as sinners , so by the obedience of the one the many will be set down as righteous .",
    "45 005 020\tBut law came in alongside that the fall might be greater ; but where sin became greater grace became greater still ,",
    "45 005 021\tin order that as sin reigned in death grace might reign through righteousness and issue in life eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord .",
    "45 006 001\tWHAT shall we say then ? Shall we remain in sin so that grace may be great ?",
    "45 006 002\tNever . How shall we who died to sin still live in it ?",
    "45 006 003\tAre you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?",
    "45 006 004\tWe were buried with him by baptism into death , in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we too might walk in newness of life .",
    "45 006 005\tFor if we have grown into union with him by the likeness of his death , surely we shall be united with him by the likeness of his resurrection .",
    "45 006 006\tFor we know this , that our old-time humanity was crucified with him , in order that the sinful body might be made powerless , that we might no longer be slaves of sin .",
    "45 006 007\tFor one who has died has been pronounced righteous and free from sin .",
    "45 006 008\tBut if we died with Christ we believe that we shall live with him ,",
    "45 006 009\tknowing that Christ , after being raised from the dead , dies no more ; death no more reigns over him .",
    "45 006 010\tFor the death that he died , he died to sin once for all ; but the life that he lives , he lives to God .",
    "45 006 011\tSo you must think yourselves dead to sin , but living to God in Christ Jesus .",
    "45 006 012\tDo not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you will obey its lusts ,",
    "45 006 013\tand do not yield your members to sin as the instruments of wickedness ; but present yourselves to God as men once dead , but now living , and yield your members to God as the instruments of righteousness .",
    "45 006 014\tFor sin shall not be king over you ; for you are not under law , but under grace .",
    "45 006 015\tWhat then ? May we sin because we are not under law , but under grace ? Never .",
    "45 006 016\tDo you not know that to whom you present yourselves as servants intending obedience , you are the servants of the one you obey , whether of sin , resulting in death , or of obedience , resulting in righteousness ?",
    "45 006 017\tThanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin you became obedient from the heart to the type of teaching in which you were instructed .",
    "45 006 018\tYou were made free from sin and made servants to righteousness .",
    "45 006 019\tI am speaking humanly on account of the weakness of your human nature . As you did present your members as servants to impurity and to lawlessness to do lawlessness , so now you have presented your members as servants to righteousness for holy living .",
    "45 006 020\tWhen you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness .",
    "45 006 021\tWhat fruit did you have then ? Fruit of which you are now ashamed ; for the end of those things is death .",
    "45 006 022\tBut now freed from sin and having become servants of God you have your fruit in holy living and its outcome , life eternal .",
    "45 006 023\tFor the wages of sin is death , but the gracious gift of God is life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord .",
    "45 007 001\tARE you ignorant , brethren , for I am speaking to those who know law , that the Law rules over a person while he is living ?",
    "45 007 002\tFor a married woman is by law bound to her husband while he is living . But if the husband dies , she is freed from the law of her husband .",
    "45 007 003\tTherefore while her husband is living she is called an adulteress if she becomes another man's . But if her husband dies she is free from the law , so that she is not an adulteress when she becomes another man's .",
    "45 007 004\tSo , my brethren , you were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ , that you might become wedded to another , to him who was raised from the dead , that we might bear fruit to God .",
    "45 007 005\tFor when we were in the flesh the sinful passions that arise through the Law were active in our members , so that we bore fruit to death .",
    "45 007 006\tBut now the Law has been made inoperative on us , since we have died to that by which we were held , so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter .",
    "45 007 007\tWhat shall we say then ? Is the Law sin ? Never . But I should not have come to know sin except through the Law . I should not have known lust if the Law had not said , \" Thou shalt not lust . \"",
    "45 007 008\tSin , taking occasion through the commandment , worked in me every lust . For apart from the Law sin is dead .",
    "45 007 009\tI was living once , apart from law . But when the commandment came , sin began to live and I died ,",
    "45 007 010\tand the commandment which meant life was found to mean death .",
    "45 007 011\tFor sin , taking occasion through the commandment , deceived me and by it killed me .",
    "45 007 012\tSo the Law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good .",
    "45 007 013\tDid then what is good become death to me ? Never . But sin , that it might appear sin , worked death in me through the good , in order that it might become beyond measure sinful .",
    "45 007 014\tFor we know that the Law is spiritual ; but I am fleshly , sold under sin .",
    "45 007 015\tFor what I am doing I do not understand . For not what I choose is what I practice , but what I hate , this I do .",
    "45 007 016\tBut if I do what I do not choose , I agree with the law that it is right .",
    "45 007 017\tAnd now it is no longer I that do it , but the Sin that dwells in me .",
    "45 007 021\tI find then this rule , when I choose to do the right , that evil is present with me .",
    "45 007 022\tI delight in the Law in my inner man ,",
    "45 007 023\tbut I see another law in my members , warring with the law of my mind and leading me captive under the law of sin which is in my members .",
    "45 007 024\tWretched man that I am ! who will deliver me from this body of death ?",
    "45 007 025\tThanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then I myself with my mind serve the Law of God , but with my flesh the law of sin .",
    "45 008 001\tTHERE is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus .",
    "45 008 002\tFor the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed you from the Law of sin and death .",
    "45 008 003\tFor , what was impossible for the Law , because it was weak through the flesh â God , sending his own Son in the form of sinful flesh and for sin , condemned the sin that is in the flesh ,",
    "45 008 004\tso that the righteousness required by the Law might be fulfilled in us who live not according to the flesh , but according to the spirit .",
    "45 008 005\tFor those who are living according to the flesh have their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who are living according to the spirit have their minds on the things of the spirit .",
    "45 008 006\tFleshly mindedness is death , but spiritual mindedness is life and peace .",
    "45 008 007\tTherefore fleshly mindedness is hostile to God ; for it is not subject to the Law of God , nor can it be .",
    "45 008 008\tThose who are in the flesh cannot please God .",
    "45 008 009\tBut you are not in the flesh , but in the spirit , if the Spirit of God dwells in you . If any one has not the Spirit of Christ , that man is not his .",
    "45 008 010\tIf Christ is in you the body is dead because of sin , but the spirit is life because of righteousness .",
    "45 008 011\tIf the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead gives life even to your mortal bodies , through his indwelling Spirit in you .",
    "45 008 012\tSo then , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh to live according to the flesh ;",
    "45 008 013\tfor if you live according to the flesh , you will die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body , you will live .",
    "45 008 014\tFor as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .",
    "45 008 015\tFor you did not receive a spirit of bondage leading again to fear , but you received a spirit of sonship , in which we cry , Abba , Father .",
    "45 008 016\tThe Spirit itself witnesses with our spirits that we are children of God .",
    "45 008 017\tAnd if children , we are also heirs â heirs of God , joint heirs with Christ , since we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him .",
    "45 008 018\tFor I estimate that the sufferings of this present time amount to nothing in comparison with the glory that is to be revealed for us .",
    "45 008 019\tFor the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God .",
    "45 008 020\tFor the creation was made subject to folly not willingly , but for the sake of him who subjected it , in hope ,",
    "45 008 021\tbecause the creation itself will be freed from the slavery of decay into the glorious freedom of the children of God .",
    "45 008 022\tFor we know that all the creation groans in the pangs of childbirth until now .",
    "45 008 023\tAnd not the creation alone , but we ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit , groan within ourselves in expectation of the sonship , the liberation of our bodies .",
    "45 008 024\tFor we are saved by hope ; but hope that is seen is not hope , for what any one sees , why does he hope for ?",
    "45 008 025\tBut if we hope for what we do not see , we patiently wait for it .",
    "45 008 026\tThus also the Spirit helps us in our weakness . For we do not know what to pray for as we ought , but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with sighs beyond words .",
    "45 008 027\tAnd he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit , because he intercedes for the holy according to the will of God .",
    "45 008 028\tWe know that all things work together for good to those who love God , to those who are called according to his purpose .",
    "45 008 029\tFor those whom he foreknew he also predetermined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the first-born among many brethren .",
    "45 008 030\tAnd those whom he predetermined he also called , and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous , and those whom he pronounced righteous he also glorified .",
    "45 008 031\tWhat then shall we say to this ? If God is for us , who is against us ?",
    "45 008 032\tHe who did not spare his own Son , but gave him up for us all , how shall he not with him graciously give us all things ?",
    "45 008 033\tWho shall bring a charge against God's elect ? God pronounces them righteous .",
    "45 008 034\tWho is there to condemn ? Christ Jesus died , or rather was raised , and he is on the right hand of God interceding for us .",
    "45 008 035\tWho shall separate us from Christ's love ? Shall trial or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword ?",
    "45 008 037\tOn the contrary , in all these we more than conquer through him who loved us .",
    "45 008 038\tFor I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor archangels , nor things present nor things to come , nor powers ,",
    "45 008 039\tnor height nor depth nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God's love in Christ Jesus our Lord .",
    "45 009 001\tI AM speaking the truth in Christ ; I am saying nothing false ; my conscience bears witness with me in the Holy Spirit",
    "45 009 002\tthat I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart .",
    "45 009 003\tFor I could wish myself to be accursed and cast away from Christ for the sake of my brethren , my kinsmen according to the flesh ,",
    "45 009 004\twho are Israelites , whose is the sonship and the glory and the covenants and the reception of the law and the worship and the promises ;",
    "45 009 005\twhose are the fathers and from whom by physical descent the Christ came . God who is over all be blessed through the ages ! Amen .",
    "45 009 006\tNot that God's word has failed . For not all who are of Israel are Israel ;",
    "45 009 007\tnor because they are descendants of Abraham are they all children ; but \" through Isaac shall your descendants be named . \"",
    "45 009 008\tThat is , not the physical descendants are children , but the children of the promise are counted for descendants .",
    "45 009 009\tFor the wording of the promise was , \" At this time next year I will come and Sarah shall have a son . \"",
    "45 009 010\tAnd not only so , but when Rebecca was about to bear children to our father Isaac ,",
    "45 009 011\tthough the same man was father of both children and they were not yet born and had done nothing good or bad , in order that the purpose of God according to his choice might stand , not according to their works , but according to his call ,",
    "45 009 012\tit was said to her , \" The older shall serve the younger . \"",
    "45 009 013\tIn the same way it is written , \" Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . \"",
    "45 009 014\tWhat shall we say then ? Is there unrighteousness on God's part ? Never .",
    "45 009 015\tFor he says to Moses , \" I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . \"",
    "45 009 016\tSo then it is not a question of the man who wills or who runs , but of God who shows mercy .",

    "45 010 004\tFor Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every believer .",

    "45 010 012\tFor there is no difference between Jew and Greek . For there is the same Lord of all , rich toward all who call upon him .",

    "46 007 033\tThe married man is anxious about the things of the world â how he may please his wife ,",
    "46 007 034\tand his interest is divided . So the unmarried woman or the maiden is anxious about the things of the Lord , that she may be holy in body and spirit . But the married woman is anxious about the things of the world â how she may please her husband .",
    "46 007 035\tThis I say for your benefit , not to throw a noose over you , but to promote decorum and constant devotion to the Lord without distraction .",

    "46 008 002\tIf any one think ; that he knows anything , he does not yet know as he ought to know .",
    "46 008 003\tIf any one loves God , he is known by him .",
    "46 008 004\tRegarding the eating of things that have been sacrificed to idols , then , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is no God but one .",
    "46 008 005\tAnd though there are so-called gods in heaven and on earth , for there are gods many and lords many ,",
    "46 008 006\tstill to us there is one God the Father , of whom are all things and we for him , and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things and we through him .",
    "46 008 007\tBut all have not this knowledge . Some , having been accustomed to idols up to the present time , eat the food as a sacrifice to an idol , and their conscience being weak is stained .",
    "46 008 008\tBut food does not bring us near to God , for neither do we lose by not eating nor gain by eating .",
    "46 008 009\tBut be careful that this power of yours may not become a stumbling block to the weak .",
    "46 008 010\tFor if any one sees you who have knowledge reclining at table in an idol's temple , will not the conscience of that weak one be emboldened to eat things that have been sacrificed to idols ?",
    "46 008 011\tThus the weak man is ruined by your knowledge â the brother for whom Christ died .",
    "46 008 012\tSo sinning against the brethren and wounding their weak consciences you sin against Christ .",
    "46 008 013\tTherefore if food makes my brother stumble I will not eat meat while the world stands , for fear of making my brother stumble .",
    "46 009 001\tAM I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you not my work in the Lord ?",

    "46 009 006\tOr am I only , and Barnabas , without the right not to do manual labor ?",
    "46 009 007\tWho ever serves as a soldier and supplies his own pay and rations ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it ? Who keeps a flock and does not drink any of the milk of the flock ?",
    "46 009 008\tAm I saying these things from a man's point of view or does not the Law also say them ?",
    "46 009 009\tFor in the Law of Moses it is written , \" You shall not muzzle an ox when he is treading out grain . \" Is God thinking of the oxen ?",
    "46 009 010\tor does he say this wholly for our sakes ? For our sakes ; for it was written because the plowman ought to plow in hope and the thresher ought to thresh in hope of having a share .",
    "46 009 011\tIf we sowed for you things of the spirit , is it a great matter if we reap your things of the flesh ?",
    "46 009 012\tIf others share this right over you , do not we still more ? But we have not used this right . No , we endure all things in order not to cause any hindrance to the good news of Christ .",
    "46 009 013\tDo you not know that those who do the work of the Temple eat the things that come from the Temple , and those who minister at the altar share with the altar ?",
    "46 009 014\tSo the Lord has directed that those who proclaim the good news shall have their living from the good news .",
    "46 009 015\tBut I have used none of these rights and I am not writing this in order that it may be done in my case . For it would be better for me to die â No one shall make my boast an empty one !",
    "46 009 016\tFor although I tell the good news I have nothing to boast of . For a necessity is laid upon me . Alas for me if I do not tell the good news !",
    "46 009 017\tIf I do it voluntarily I have a reward , but if reluctantly , I have been charged with a responsibility .",
    "46 009 018\tWhat then is my reward ? That in telling the good news I make the good news free , and do not take full advantage of my rights in the good news .",
    "46 009 019\tFor though I am free from all I have enslaved myself to all that I may gain the more .",
    "46 009 020\tI became to the Jews a Jew , to gain the Jews ; to those under law as under law , though not myself under law , to gain those who are under law .",
    "46 009 021\tTo those without law , I became as without law , though not without the law of God and under the law of Christ , to gain those who are without law .",
    "46 009 022\tTo the weak I became weak to gain the weak . To all men I became all things in order by all means to save some .",
    "46 009 023\tI do all things for the sake of the good news that I may become a partner with it .",
    "46 009 024\tDo you not know that those who run in a stadium all run , yet one gets the prize ? Run so as to win .",
    "46 009 025\tEvery one who contends in the games practices self-restraint in all things . They do it to win a fading crown , but we for an unfading one .",
    "46 009 026\tThus I run with no uncertain goal : thus I strike , not as if pounding the air .",
    "46 009 027\tOn the contrary , I maul and master my body so that I may not , after preaching to others , become myself unable to stand the test .",
    "46 010 001\tI DO not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea",
    "46 010 002\tand all received baptism in the cloud and in the sea ,",
    "46 010 003\tand all ate the same spiritual food",
    "46 010 004\tand all drank the same spiritual drink . For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ .",
    "46 010 005\tBut with the most of them God was not well pleased . For they were strewn in the desert .",
    "46 010 006\tThese things happened as warnings for us , that we may not be eager for evil things as they were eager .",

    "46 010 010\tNor murmur , as some of them murmured and perished by the destroyer .",
    "46 010 011\tThese things happened to those people as warnings and they were written for the instruction of us to whom the closing events of the ages have come .",

    "46 010 013\tNo trial has taken you but what belongs to human nature . God is faithful and he will not let you be tried beyond your power , but will make , with the trial , a way of escape so that you can endure it .",

    "46 010 018\tLook at Israel according to the flesh ; are not those who eat of the sacrifice partakers of the altar ?",
    "46 010 019\tWhat then am I saying ? That meat sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything ?",
    "46 010 020\tBut I say that what they sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God . And I would not have you become partakers with demons .",
    "46 010 021\tYou cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons .",

    "46 011 006\tFor if a woman is not covered , then let her cut off her hair . But if it is a shame to a woman to cut off her hair or to shave , let her veil herself .",
    "46 011 007\tFor a man has no need to cover his head since he is the image and glory of God . But the woman is the glory of man .",
    "46 011 008\tFor man was not from woman , but woman from man ,",
    "46 011 009\tfor man was not formed for woman , but woman for man .",
    "46 011 010\tTherefore , the woman ought to have a badge of authority on her head because of the angels .",
    "46 011 011\tYet neither is woman without man nor man without woman in the Lord .",
    "46 011 012\tFor as woman is from man so is man through woman , but all things from God .",
    "46 011 013\tDecide for yourselves : is it becoming for a woman to pray to God unveiled ?",
    "46 011 014\tDoes not Nature herself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a dishonor to him ,",
    "46 011 015\tbut that if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her ? Because the hair is given to her for a covering .",
    "46 011 016\tBut if any one cares to be contentious , we have no such custom , nor have the churches of God .",
    "46 011 017\tIn giving the following directions I do not praise you , because you do not assemble for the better , but for the worse .",
    "46 011 018\tFor , in the first place , I hear that when you assemble as a church there are parties among you , and to some extent I believe it .",
    "46 011 019\tFor there must be parties among you in order that it may become plain who are worthy of approval .",
    "46 011 020\tWhen , therefore , you assemble it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper .",
    "46 011 021\tFor in eating each one tries to get his own supper first and one is hungry and another is drunken .",
    "46 011 022\tHave you not homes to eat and drink in ? Or do you mean to show contempt for the church of God and put to shame those who have no homes ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you ? For this I do not praise you .",
    "46 011 023\tFor I received from the Lord that which I passed on to you that the Lord Jesus , on the night in which he was betrayed , took bread ,",
    "46 011 024\tand when he had given thanks he broke it and said , \" This is my body which is broken for you . Do this in memory of me . \"",
    "46 011 025\tIn like manner he took also the cup after supper , saying , \" This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Do this , as often as you drink it , in memory of me . \"",
    "46 011 026\tFor as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord's death , until he comes .",
    "46 011 027\tTherefore , whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .",
    "46 011 028\tBut let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup .",
    "46 011 029\tFor he who eats and drinks eats and drinks condemnation to himself , if he does not honor the Lord's body .",
    "46 011 030\tFor this reason many are weak and sickly among you and a number are asleep .",
    "46 011 031\tIf we judged ourselves we should not be judged .",
    "46 011 032\tBut when we are judged by the Lord , we are disciplined in order that we may not be condemned along with the world .",
    "46 011 033\tSo then , my brethren , when you assemble to eat , wait for one another .",
    "46 011 034\tIf any one is hungry , let him eat at home , that your assembling may not bring condemnation on you . The other matters I will arrange when I come .",
    "46 012 001\tCONCERNING spiritual things , brethren , I do not wish you to be ignorant .",
    "46 012 002\tFor you know that when you were Gentiles you were led away after the dumb idols just as might happen .",
    "46 012 003\tTherefore I inform you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says , \" Jesus is accursed , \" and no one can say , \" Jesus is Lord , \" except in the Holy Spirit .",
    "46 012 004\tThere are varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit .",
    "46 012 005\tAnd there are varieties of service , but the same Lord .",
    "46 012 006\tAnd there are varieties of products , but the same God who produces all things in all .",
    "46 012 007\tTo each one is given some manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable .",
    "46 012 008\tTo one are given , through the Spirit , words of wisdom , to another words of knowledge by the same Spirit ,",
    "46 012 009\tto another faith by the same Spirit , to another gifts of healing by the same Spirit ,",
    "46 012 010\tto another works of power , to another prophecy , to another the discernment of spirits , to another varieties of tongues , to another interpretation of tongues .",
    "46 012 011\tOne and the same Spirit produces all of these gifts , distributing to each one individually as he will .",
    "46 012 012\tFor as the body is one and yet has many members , and all the members of the body , though many , are one body , so also is Christ .",
    "46 012 013\tFor in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether slaves or free , and were all made to drink of one Spirit .",
    "46 012 014\tFor the body is not one member , but many .",
    "46 012 015\tIf the foot says , \" Because I am not a hand I am not of the body , \" it is not for that reason not of the body .",
    "46 012 016\tAnd if the ear says , \" Because I am not an eye I am not of the body , \" it is not for that reason not of the body .",
    "46 012 017\tIf the whole body were an eye , where would be the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where would be the smelling ?",
    "46 012 018\tBut now God has placed the members each one of them in the body as he pleased .",
    "46 012 019\tIf all were one member , where would be the body ?",
    "46 012 020\tBut now the members are many , but the body is one .",
    "46 012 021\tAnd the eye cannot say to the hand , \" I have no need of you , \" or the head to the feet , \" I have no need of you . \"",
    "46 012 022\tIndeed , much more those members of the body that seem to be the weaker are necessary ,",
    "46 012 023\tand those that we deem the less honorable parts of the body we surround with greater honor and our uncomely parts have additional dignity ,",
    "46 012 024\twhile our comely parts have no need . But God has organized the body , giving greater honor to the part that lacks ,",
    "46 012 025\tthat there may be no discord in the body , but that the members may have a common concern for one another .",
    "46 012 026\tAnd if one member suffers , all the members suffer with it ; if a member is honored , all the members rejoice with it .",
    "46 012 027\tYou are the body of Christ and individually members .",
    "46 012 028\tGod placed some in the church first as apostles , secondly as prophets , thirdly as teachers , then miracle-workers , then those with gifts of healing , helpers , administrators , speakers of different kinds of tongues .",
    "46 012 029\tAre all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Are all miracle-workers ?",
    "46 012 030\tDo all have gifts of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?",
    "46 012 031\tSeek earnestly for the greater gifts ; and yet I will show you a way that surpasses all .",
    "46 013 001\tIF I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , but have not love , I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal .",
    "46 013 002\tAnd if I have the power of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .",
    "46 013 003\tAnd if I distribute all that I have to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but have not love , it profits me nothing .",
    "46 013 004\tLove is longsuffering , love is kind , is not jealous , love does not boast , is not conceited ,",
    "46 013 005\tdoes not behave unbecomingly , does not seek her own interest , is not irritable , does not count up her wrongs ,",
    "46 013 006\tdoes not rejoice in wickedness , but rejoices with the truth ,",
    "46 013 007\texcuses all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .",
    "46 013 008\tLove never fails ; but if there are prophetic powers , they will become useless ; if there are tongues , they will cease ; if there is knowledge , it will become useless .",
    "46 013 009\tFor we know in part and we prophesy in part ,",
    "46 013 010\tbut when the perfect comes what is in part will become useless .",
    "46 013 011\tWhen I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . Since I have become a man , I have no use for childish things .",
    "46 013 012\tFor as yet we are looking at puzzling reflections in a mirror , but then face to face . As yet I know in part , but then I shall know fully , as I have been fully known .",
    "46 013 013\tBut now faith , hope , love â these three â endure . And the greatest of these is love .",
    "46 014 001\tSEEK love earnestly , be eager for spiritual gifts , but most to prophesy .",
    "46 014 002\tFor he who speaks with a tongue speaks not to men , but to God . For no one understands , and he speaks mysteries in the Spirit .",
    "46 014 003\tBut he who prophesies speaks to men what will build up , encourage , and comfort .",
    "46 014 004\tHe who speaks in a tongue builds himself up , but he who prophesies builds up the church .",
    "46 014 005\tI wish you all to speak with tongues , but I wish more to have you prophesy . He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues , unless he interprets so that the church may receive upbuilding .",
    "46 014 006\tNow , brethren , if I come to you speaking with tongues , what benefit will I be to you unless I speak to you in a revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching .",
    "46 014 007\tInanimate things that give a sound , such as the flute or harp , â unless they give a distinction in the sounds , how will it be known what is being played on flute or harp ?",
    "46 014 008\tIf the trumpet gives a dubious sound , who will prepare himself for battle ?",
    "46 014 009\tAnd so you , if you do not give by the tongue words easy to understand , how will it be known what is said ? For you will be talking into the air .",
    "46 014 010\tThere are , it may be , so many kinds of languages in the world , and none without meaning .",
    "46 014 011\tIf then I do not know the meaning of the language , I shall be a barbarian to him who is speaking , and he will be a barbarian to me .",
    "46 014 012\tAnd so you , since you are eager for spiritual gifts , seek to abound in what will build up the church .",
    "46 014 013\tTherefore let him who speaks with a tongue pray to interpret .",
    "46 014 014\tFor if I pray in a tongue my spirit prays , but my understanding is unfruitful .",
    "46 014 015\tWhat then ? I will pray with the spirit and with the understanding . I will sing with the spirit and with the understanding .",
    "46 014 016\tIf you thank God with the spirit , how shall he who fills the place of the ordinary man say Amen to your thanksgiving ? For he does not know what you are saying .",
    "46 014 017\tYou give thanks excellently , but the other is not helped by it .",
    "46 014 018\tI thank God that I speak with tongues more than any of you .",
    "46 014 019\tBut in church I would rather speak five words with my understanding so as to instruct others , than to speak ten thousand words in a tongue .",
    "46 014 020\tBrethren , be not children in intelligence , but be babes in wickedness . In intelligence be adults .",
    "46 014 021\tIn the Law it is written , \" By men of strange speech and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people , and not even thus will they listen to me , says the Lord . \"",
    "46 014 022\tSo then tongues are for a sign not to believers , but to unbelievers , and prophecy is not for unbelievers , but for believers .",
    "46 014 023\tIf therefore the whole church assembles and all speak with tongues and ordinary men or unbelievers come in , will they not say that you are insane ?",
    "46 014 024\tBut if all prophesy and any unbeliever or ordinary man comes in , he is convinced by all , he is judged by all ,",
    "46 014 025\tthe secrets of his heart become manifest , and so falling on his face he worships God , declaring that God is really among you .",
    "46 014 026\tWhat then , brethren ? When you assemble each one has a psalm , has a teaching , has a revelation , has a tongue , has an interpretation . Let all things be done for the upbuilding of character .",
    "46 014 027\tIf any one speaks with a tongue , let it be two , or at the most three , at a time and in turn and let one interpret .",
    "46 014 028\tIf there is no interpreter , let the man keep silent in church and let him speak to himself and to God .",
    "46 014 029\tOf the prophets let two or three speak and let the others reflect .",
    "46 014 030\tIf a revelation comes to another who is sitting by , let the first become silent .",
    "46 014 031\tFor you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged .",
    "46 014 032\tThe spirits of the prophets are under the control of the prophets .",
    "46 014 033\tFor God is not a God of confusion , but of peace . As in all the churches of the holy ,",
    "46 014 034\tlet the women be silent in your assemblies . For it is not allowed to them to speak ; but let them be in subjection as also the Law says .",
    "46 014 035\tIf they wish to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home . For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church .",
    "46 014 036\tDid the message of God come out from you or did it come to you alone ?",
    "46 014 037\tIf any one thinks himself a prophet or spiritual , let him recognize that what I am writing to you is the command of the Lord .",
    "46 014 038\tBut if any one does not know , he is himself unknown .",
    "46 014 039\tSo then , my brethren , seek earnestly to prophesy and do not hinder speaking with tongues .",
    "46 014 040\tLet all things be done becomingly and in order .",
    "46 015 001\tLET me recall to your minds , brethren , the good news which I announced to you and which you accepted , in which also you stand ,",
    "46 015 002\tthrough which also you are being saved , if you hold fast the message that I announced to you , unless your faith was thoughtless .",
    "46 015 003\tFor among the first things I passed on to you what I had received , that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,",
    "46 015 004\tand that he was buried , and that he was raised on the third day , according to the Scriptures ,",
    "46 015 005\tand that he was seen by Cephas , then by the twelve ,",
    "46 015 006\tthen he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once , of whom the most are still living , but some have fallen asleep ,",
    "46 015 007\tthen he appeared to James , then to all the apostles .",
    "46 015 008\tLast of all , as if to one untimely born , he appeared also to me .",
    "46 015 009\tFor I am the least of the apostles and am not fit to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .",
    "46 015 010\tBut by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace toward me was not without result , but I labored more abundantly than all of them , yet not I , but the grace of God that was with me .",
    "46 015 011\tWhether then it was I or they , so we proclaim and so you believed .",
    "46 015 012\tBut if Christ is proclaimed â that he has been raised from the dead â how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?",
    "46 015 013\tIf there is no resurrection of the dead , then neither has Christ been raised .",
    "46 015 014\tIf Christ has not been raised , then our proclamation is an empty thing and your faith is an empty thing .",
    "46 015 015\tAnd we are found false witnesses of God because we testified regarding God that he raised up Christ , whom he did not raise if the dead are not raised .",
    "46 015 016\tFor if the dead are not raised , neither has Christ been raised .",
    "46 015 017\tAnd if Christ has not been raised , your faith is futile , you are still in your sins .",
    "46 015 018\tThen also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .",
    "46 015 019\tIf in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most pitiable .",
    "46 015 020\tBut now Christ has been raised from the dead , the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep .",
    "46 015 021\tFor since by a man came death , by a man also came resurrection of the dead .",
    "46 015 022\tFor as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .",
    "46 015 023\tBut each in his own order . The first-fruit is Christ , then those who are Christ's , at his coming .",
    "46 015 024\tThen will be the end when he delivers up the kingship to God his Father , when he has defeated every archangel and authority and power .",
    "46 015 025\tFor he must be king until he \" puts all his enemies under his feet . \"",
    "46 015 026\tThe last enemy to be defeated will be death .",
    "46 015 027\tFor \" he subjected all things under his feet . \" But when it says , \" all things have been subjected , \" it is plain that it means all things except God who subjected all things to him .",
    "46 015 028\tBut when all things have been subjected to him , then the Son himself will be subjected to him who subjected all things to him , that God may be all in all .",
    "46 015 029\tThen what shall they do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead do not rise at all , why are they then baptized for them ?",
    "46 015 030\tAnd why do we run risks every hour ?",
    "46 015 031\tI die every day , I swear it by the boast I make of you and which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord .",
    "46 015 032\tIf , humanly speaking , I fought wild beasts at Ephesus , what is my gain ? If the dead do not rise , \" let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die . \"",
    "46 015 033\tDo not be led astray ; \" bad associations corrupt good morals . \"",
    "46 015 034\tReturn to soberness and cease to sin , for some are ignorant of God . I say it to your shame .",
    "46 015 035\tBut some one will say , How are the dead raised , and with what sort of bodies do they come ?",
    "46 015 036\tThoughtless man ! What you yourself sow does not come to life unless it dies .",
    "46 015 037\tAnd what you sow is not the body that will come , but a mere grain , perhaps of wheat or of something else .",
    "46 015 038\tBut God gives it a body as he has pleased , and to each kind of seed a body of its own .",
    "46 015 039\tAll flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another flesh of birds , and another flesh of fishes .",
    "46 015 040\tThere are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial . But the glory of the celestial is of one kind and the glory of the terrestrial is of another .",
    "46 015 041\tThere is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars . For star differs from star in glory .",
    "46 015 042\tSo also will be the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in decay ; it is raised imperishable .",
    "46 015 043\tIt is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .",
    "46 015 044\tIt is sown an animal body ; it is raised a spiritual body . If there is an animal body there is also a spiritual body .",
    "46 015 045\tJust as it is written , \" The first man Adam became a living animal , \" the last Adam became a lifegiving spirit .",
    "46 015 046\tBut the spiritual is not first , but the animal , then the spiritual .",
    "46 015 047\tThe first man was from the earth , earthly ; the second man is the Lord from heaven .",
    "46 015 048\tAs is the earthly man such are also those who are earthly , and as is the heavenly man such are also those who are heavenly .",
    "46 015 049\tAnd as we have borne the image of the earthly man , we shall bear the image of the heavenly man .",
    "46 015 050\tBut I say this , brethren , flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God , nor will decay inherit imperishability .",
    "46 015 051\tI am telling you a mystery . We shall not all fall asleep , but we shall all be transformed ,",
    "46 015 052\tin a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet-call . For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable , and we shall be transformed .",
    "46 015 053\tFor this perishable must clothe itself with imperishability , and this mortal must clothe itself with immortality .",
    "46 015 054\tWhen this perishable has clothed itself with imperishability and this mortal has clothed itself with immortality , then will come to pass the word that is written , \" Death has been swallowed up in victory .",
    "46 015 055\tO Death , where is thy victory ? O Death , where is thy sting ? \"",
    "46 015 056\tThe sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the Law .",
    "46 015 057\tBut thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ !",
    "46 015 058\tSo then , my beloved brethren , be firm , immovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord ; since you know that your labor is not fruitless in the Lord .",

    "46 016 019\tThe churches of Asia send you their greetings . Aquila and Prisca with the church in their house greet you heartily in the Lord .",
    "46 016 020\tAll the brethren send greetings to you . Greet one another with a holy kiss .",

    "47 001 001\tPAUL , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy the brother , to the church of God that is in Corinth with all the holy that are in all Achaia :",
    "47 001 002\tGrace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !",
    "47 001 003\tBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of loving kindness and the God of all encouragement ,",
    "47 001 004\twho encourages us in every distress so that we may be able to encourage those who are in every distress by the encouragement by which we ourselves have been encouraged by God .",
    "47 001 005\tBecause as the sufferings of Christ are abundant in our case , so through Christ our encouragement is abundant .",
    "47 001 006\tBut if we are in distress , it is for your encouragement and salvation . If we are encouraged , it is for your encouragement which is effective in the endurance of the same sufferings that we suffer .",
    "47 001 007\tOur hope is strong regarding you , since we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings so you are of the encouragement .",
    "47 001 008\tFor we do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , regarding the distress that came on us in Asia â that we were exceedingly weighed down , beyond our strength , so that we despaired even of life .",
    "47 001 009\tIndeed we have the sentence of death within ourselves , that our trust may not rest on ourselves , but on God who raises the dead .",
    "47 001 010\tHe delivered us from such a death and will deliver , and we have hope in him that he will go on delivering ,",
    "47 001 011\twhile you help by your prayers for us , so that from many persons thanksgiving may arise for the gift granted to us through the prayers of many for us .",
    "47 001 012\tFor this is what we boast of , the witness of our conscience that in holiness , and sincerity before God , not in fleshly wisdom , but in the grace of God , we have lived in the world and especially toward you .",

    "47 001 014\tas you have partly acknowledged it about us , that we are your ground of boasting and you are ours on the day of our Lord Jesus .",
    "47 001 015\tWith this confidence I intended to come to you first , so that you might have a second favor ,",
    "47 001 016\tby my visiting you on the way to Macedonia and again coming back from Macedonia to you and being sped by you on my way toward Juda .",
    "47 001 017\tWhen I was intending this , did I show fickleness ? Or do I plan what I plan according to the flesh , so that I may say yes , yes , and no , no ?",
    "47 001 018\tAs God is faithful , my word to you is not yes and no .",
    "47 001 019\tFor the Son of God , Christ Jesus , who was proclaimed among you by us â myself and Silvanus and Timothy â was not yes and no , but in him was yes .",
    "47 001 020\tFor all the promises of God , however many , have their yes in him . Therefore also through him is the Amen to the glory of God through us .",
    "47 001 021\tIt is God who makes us and you steadfast to Christ , and has anointed us",
    "47 001 022\tand sealed us and has given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts .",
    "47 001 023\tI call God as a witness against my soul that in order to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth .",
    "47 001 024\tNot that we are lords over your faith , but fellow workers sharing your joy , for you are standing firm in the faith .",
    "47 002 001\tBUT I decided this in my own mind , not to come again to you in sorrow .",
    "47 002 002\tFor if I grieve you , who is there to cheer me except those who are grieved by me ?",
    "47 002 003\tI am writing this very thing so that I may not come and have grief from those who ought to make me glad , for I am confident in regard to all of you that my joy is yours .",
    "47 002 004\tFor out of great distress and pain of heart I am writing with many tears , not that you may be grieved , but that you may know the love that I have beyond measure for you .",
    "47 002 005\tBut if any one has caused grief , he has grieved not me , but to some extent â not to be too severe â all of you .",
    "47 002 006\tSufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority ,",
    "47 002 007\tso that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and encourage him , that such a one may not be swallowed up in excessive grief .",
    "47 002 008\tTherefore I beg you to assure him of your love .",
    "47 002 009\tBecause for this purpose I am writing , that I may know your tested character , whether you are obedient in everything .",
    "47 002 010\tTo whomever you forgive anything I also forgive it , and what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , it was for your sake in the sight of Christ ,",
    "47 002 011\tthat Satan may not take advantage of us , for we are not ignorant of his purposes .",
    "47 002 012\tWhen I came to Troas for the good news of Christ and a door had been opened for me in the Lord ,",
    "47 002 013\tI had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother , but bidding them farewell I came away to Macedonia .",
    "47 002 014\tThanks be to God who always leads us in his triumph in Christ and spreads through us the sweet odor of the knowledge of him in every place .",
    "47 002 015\tFor we are for God a sweet odor of Christ â in the saved and in the perishing .",
    "47 002 016\tTo the latter an odor from death to death , to the former an odor from life to life . And who is competent for this ?",
    "47 002 017\tFor we are not , like the most , adulterating the message of God for gain , but in sincerity , as from God , in the presence of God , we speak in Christ .",
    "47 003 001\tARE we beginning again to recommend ourselves ? Do we need , as some do , letters of recommendation to you or from you ?",
    "47 003 002\tYou are our letter , written in our hearts , known and read by all men ,",
    "47 003 003\tevidently a letter of Christ delivered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God , not on stone tablets , but on tablets that are hearts of flesh .",
    "47 003 004\tWe have such confidence through Christ toward God .",
    "47 003 005\tNot that of ourselves we are fit to reason out anything as from ourselves , but our fitness is from God ,",
    "47 003 006\twho has fitted us to be servants of a new covenant , not of the letter , but of the spirit . For the letter kills , but the spirit gives life .",
    "47 003 007\tIf the service that brought death , engraved in letters on stones , came in glory , so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face â that fading glory â",
    "47 003 008\thow much more glorious will not the service of the Spirit be ?",
    "47 003 009\tFor if the service that brought condemnation was glory , much more will the service that brings righteousness surpass in glory .",
    "47 003 010\tFor what was made so glorious is in a way no longer glorious compared with the glory that surpasses it .",
    "47 003 011\tFor if what was to be ended came in glory , much more glorious must be that which is enduring .",
    "47 003 012\tWith such a hope then we speak with great frankness ,",
    "47 003 013\tand are not like Moses , who used to put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel might not see when the vanishing glory ended ;",
    "47 003 014\tbut their thinking was dulled . For to this day the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read ; because it is done away only in Christ .",
    "47 003 015\tTo this day when Moses is read the veil lies on their hearts ;",
    "47 003 016\t\" but when they turn to the Lord the veil is taken away . \"",
    "47 003 017\tThe Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty .",
    "47 003 018\tAnd we all , with unveiled face , reflecting the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same likeness from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord .",
    "47 004 001\tTHEREFORE , having this service through God's mercy , we are not downhearted ,",
    "47 004 002\tbut we have renounced shameful secret things , not living in craftiness nor adulterating God's message , but by the openness of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God .",
    "47 004 003\tIf our good news is veiled , it is veiled to those who are going to ruin ,",
    "47 004 004\tin whom the god of this world has blinded the thinking of the unbelieving so that the light of the glorious good news of Christ , who is the image of God , may not shine in .",
    "47 004 005\tFor we are not proclaiming ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus ' sake .",
    "47 004 006\tBecause it is the God who said , \" Light shall shine out of darkness , \" who has shone in our hearts bringing the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the face of Christ .",
    "47 004 007\tBut we have this treasure in earthen jars , that the surpassing power may be God's and not ours â",
    "47 004 008\tin every way distressed , but not reduced to straits , perplexed , but not in despair ,",
    "47 004 009\tpersecuted , but not forsaken , cast down , but not destroyed ,",
    "47 004 010\talways bearing about in our bodies the death of Jesus that the life also of Jesus may be manifest in our bodies .",
    "47 004 011\tFor we , though living , are always delivered up to death for Jesus ' sake , that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh .",
    "47 004 012\tSo death works in us , but life in you .",
    "47 004 013\tHaving the same spirit of faith , as it is written , \" I believed , therefore I spoke , \" we too believe and therefore speak ,",
    "47 004 014\tknowing that he who raised up Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus and place us in his presence with you .",
    "47 004 015\tFor all things are for your sake , that grace abounding through many may overflow in thanksgiving to the glory of God .",
    "47 004 016\tTherefore we are not downhearted , but even if our outward man is wasting away , yet our inward man is renewed day by day .",
    "47 004 017\tFor our momentary and light distress is working out for us a far surpassing and eternal weight of glory",
    "47 004 018\twhile we contemplate not the things that are seen , but the things unseen . For the things that are seen are transient , but the things unseen are eternal .",
    "47 005 001\tFOR we know that if this tent , our earthly home , is thrown down , we have a building of God , a home not made by hands , eternal in the heavens .",
    "47 005 002\tFor in this we sigh in earnest desire to put on our dwelling that comes from heaven ,",
    "47 005 003\tsince if we put that on we shall not be found naked .",
    "47 005 004\tFor while we are in this tent we sigh being burdened , not that we wish to be unclothed , but to put on the other , that what is mortal may be swallowed up in life .",
    "47 005 005\tHe who has prepared us for this very thing is God , and he has given to us the pledge of the Spirit .",
    "47 005 006\tSo being always of good courage and knowing that while living at home in the body we are living in a foreign land away from the Lord â",
    "47 005 007\tfor we walk by faith , not by sight â",
    "47 005 008\tI say we are of good courage and wish rather to live in the land foreign to the body and be at home with the Lord .",
    "47 005 009\tTherefore also we are ambitious to be pleasing to him , whether at home with him or in this foreign land .",
    "47 005 010\tFor we must all appear as we truly are before the judgment seat of Christ , that each may receive the award for what he has done with his body , according to his actions , whether good or bad .",
    "47 005 011\tKnowing , therefore , the fear of the Lord , we are persuading men . What we are is plain to God , and I hope that it is also plain to your consciences .",
    "47 005 012\tWe are not recommending ourselves again to you , but giving occasion to you for boasting on our behalf , that you may have it to use against those who boast of appearances and not of heart .",
    "47 005 013\tFor if we were out of our minds it was for God , and if we are sane it is for you .",
    "47 005 014\tFor the love of Christ impels us , convinced of this , that if one died for all , then all died ,",
    "47 005 015\tand he died for all that the living may no longer live for themselves , but for him who died for them and was raised again .",
    "47 005 016\tSo we , from now on , know no man according to the flesh . Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh , yet now we know him so no more .",
    "47 005 017\tSo if any one is in Christ he is a new creature . The old things have passed away , they have become new .",
    "47 005 018\tAnd all things are from God , who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and given to us the service of reconciliation â",
    "47 005 019\tto proclaim that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , not counting against men their sins , and that he has committed to us the message of reconciliation .",
    "47 005 020\tSo we are ambassadors for Christ , as if God were appealing to you through us . We pray you on Christ's behalf to be reconciled to God .",
    "47 005 021\tHim who knew no sin God made sin for our sake that we might become the righteousness of God in him .",
    "47 006 001\tAS God's fellow workers we also beg you not to receive his grace fruitlessly .",
    "47 006 002\tFor he says , \" At a favorable time I heard you and on a day of salvation I helped you . \" Now is a particularly favorable time , now is a day of salvation .",
    "47 006 003\tWe give no occasion for stumbling to any one that our service may not be blamed ,",
    "47 006 004\tbut in everything we commend ourselves as God's servants in great patience , in distresses , in necessities , in hardships ,",
    "47 006 005\tin floggings , in prisons , in riots , in toils , in sleepless nights , in fastings ,",
    "47 006 006\twith purity , with knowledge , with long-suffering , with kindness , with the Holy Spirit , with sincere love ,",
    "47 006 007\twith the message of truth , with the power of God ; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and the left ,",

    "47 007 001\tHAVING then these promises , beloved , let us purify ourselves from every defilement of flesh or spirit , in reverence for God making our holiness complete .",
    "47 007 002\tMake room for us in your hearts . We have wronged no one ; we have injured no one ; we have taken advantage of no one .",
    "47 007 003\tI am not saying this to condemn you , for I have already said that you have such a place in our hearts that we are ready to die with you or to live with you .",
    "47 007 004\tGreat is my frankness in speaking to you ; great is my boasting of you ; I am filled with encouragement , running over with joy at every distress of ours .",
    "47 007 005\tFor since we came to Macedonia our flesh has had no rest , but we have been distressed in every way , conflicts without , fears within .",
    "47 007 006\tBut God , who encourages the depressed , encouraged us by the coming of Titus ,",
    "47 007 007\tand not by his coming only , but also by the encouragement by which he was encouraged about you . He told us of your longing for me , your lamentation , your zeal in my behalf , so that I rejoice the more .",
    "47 007 008\tFor if I grieved you in my letter I do not regret it , though I did regret it , seeing that that letter grieved you even for a time ,",
    "47 007 009\tbut I am glad now , not that you were grieved , but that your grief led to a change of heart . You were grieved as God approves so that you should in nothing suffer loss from us .",
    "47 007 010\tFor such grief as God approves works a change of heart leading to salvation and is never to be regretted . But the grief of the world results in death .",
    "47 007 011\tNotice this very grieving as God approves , how great earnestness resulted from it in your case , what effort to defend yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what longing , what zeal , what just punishment ! In everything you showed yourselves blameless in the matter .",
    "47 007 012\tSo although I wrote to you , I did it not for the sake of him who did the wrong , nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong , but that your earnestness for us might be made plain to you before God .",
    "47 007 013\tOn this account we have been encouraged . In addition to this encouragement of ours , we rejoiced very much more over the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all ,",
    "47 007 014\tfor if I have made any boast regarding you I have not been put to shame , but as we spoke everything in truth to you so our boasting over Titus turned out the truth .",
    "47 007 015\tAnd his affections go out more strongly to you when he remembers the obedience of you all , how with reverence and trembling you received him .",
    "47 007 016\tI am glad to be in every respect of good courage regarding you .",
    "47 008 001\tI MUST tell you , brethren , of the grace of God that has been given to the churches of Macedonia ,",
    "47 008 002\tthat in a great trial of distress their abundant joy and their deep poverty have abounded in the wealth of their liberality .",
    "47 008 003\tFor according to their ability , I bear witness , and beyond their ability , of their own accord ,",
    "47 008 004\twith great urgency they begged of us the favor of fellowship in the service for the holy ,",
    "47 008 005\tand this not as we had hoped , but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through the will of God .",
    "47 008 006\tTherefore we encouraged Titus that as he had begun so he should complete this grace among you .",
    "47 008 007\tBut as you excel in every way , in faith and speech and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love you learned from us , be sure to excel in this grace also .",
    "47 008 008\tI speak not by way of command , but testing the genuineness of your love by the earnestness of others .",
    "47 008 009\tFor you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor , that you by his poverty might become rich .",
    "47 008 010\tIn this I give my opinion , for this is advantageous for you , since a year ago you were first to begin not only the doing but the wanting to do anything .",
    "47 008 011\tBut now complete the doing , that as there was a readiness in willing so there may be a completion according to your means .",
    "47 008 012\tFor if there is first the readiness , a gift is acceptable according to what a man has , not according to what he has not .",
    "47 008 013\tI do not mean that others shall have relief and you shall have trouble ,",
    "47 008 014\tbut by equality at the present time your abundance may supply their need so that their abundance may come at your need â that there may be equality ,",

    "47 008 018\tWith him we are sending the brother whose praise for service to the good news has spread through all the churches ,",
    "47 008 019\tand not only that , but he was appointed by the churches as our fellow traveler in this gracious errand carried out by us to the glory of the Lord himself and by our own eager desire .",
    "47 008 020\tWe are taking care that no one shall blame us for our administration of this bountiful fund ,",
    "47 008 021\tfor we are providing arrangements honorable , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .",
    "47 008 022\tWe are sending along with them also our brother whose earnestness we have tested many times in many ways , and who is now especially earnest because of his great confidence in you .",

    "47 008 024\tShow them in the sight of the churches your love and the ground of our boasting to them about you .",
    "47 009 001\tREGARDING the service to the holy , it is superfluous for me to write to you .",
    "47 009 002\tFor I know your readiness and I am boasting about you to the Macedonians , that Achaia was ready a year ago , and your zeal has stimulated the most of them .",
    "47 009 003\tI am sending the brethren that our boasting about you may not be proved in this matter an empty boast , so that you may be ready as I have said ,",
    "47 009 004\tand if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we , not to say you , may not be made ashamed of this confidence .",
    "47 009 005\tSo I think it necessary to urge the brethren to go on in advance to you and prepare before-hand your promised gift , that it may be ready as a gift and not as if extorted .",

    "48 002 002\tI went up by revelation , and I stated to them the good news which I proclaim among the Gentiles . But I did this privately before those who were most esteemed , that I might not be running , or have run , to no Purpose .",
    "48 002 003\tBut even Titus , who was with me and was a Greek , was not compelled to be circumcised ,",

    "48 002 006\tBut from those who were esteemed to be something â whatever they were , it makes no difference to me ; God does not regard the social standing of a man â those who were most esteemed did not impart to me anything additional .",
    "48 002 007\tBut , on the contrary , seeing that I was entrusted with the good news for the uncircumcision as Peter was for the circumcision ,",
    "48 002 008\tfor he who had worked in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcision had worked in me for the Gentiles ,",
    "48 002 009\trecognizing the grace given to me , James , Cephas , and John , who were regarded as pillars , gave the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas , that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision .",
    "48 002 010\tOnly they wished us to remember the poor . This very thing I also was earnest in doing .",
    "48 002 011\tBut when Peter came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he had been justly censured .",
    "48 002 012\tFor before certain persons came from James , he was eating with the Gentiles . But when they came , he drew back and separated himself , fearing those who were of the circumcision .",
    "48 002 013\tAnd the rest of the Jews practiced the same hypocrisy with him , so that even Barnabas was led off with them in their hypocrisy .",
    "48 002 014\tBut when I saw that they were not walking straight according to the truth of the good news , I said to Cephas before them all , \" If you who are a Jew are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews ? \"",

    "48 002 016\tknowing that a man is not declared righteous because of works of law , but through faith in Christ Jesus , we also have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be declared righteous because of faith in Christ , and not because of works of law , for because of works of law no human being will be declared righteous .",
    "48 002 017\tIf while seeking to be declared righteous in Christ we ourselves are found sinners , is Christ then a servant of sin ? Never .",
    "48 002 018\tFor if I am building up again what I pulled down , I show myself as a transgressor .",
    "48 002 019\tFor I through law died to law that I might live to God .",

    "48 002 021\tI do not make nothing of the grace of God , for if righteousness is through law , then Christ died for nothing .",
    "48 003 001\tO THOUGHTLESS Galatians , who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was pictured crucified ?",
    "48 003 002\tOnly this I wish to learn from you : Was it because of works of law that you received the Spirit , or because of hearing with faith ?",
    "48 003 003\tAre you so thoughtless ? After beginning with spirit are you now finishing with flesh ?",
    "48 003 004\tHave you suffered such things to no purpose ? â if it is to no purpose .",

    "48 003 006\tjust as Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness ?",
    "48 003 007\tYou know , then , that those who are of faith â they are children of Abraham .",
    "48 003 008\tFor the Scripture , foreseeing that God would declare the Gentiles righteous because of faith , announced the good news in advance to Abraham , \" In you all the Gentiles will be blessed . \"",

    "48 003 016\tBut the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring . It does not say , \" and to offsprings , \" as meaning many , but as if meaning one , \" and to your offspring , \" who is Christ .",
    "48 003 017\tI mean this , a covenant ratified by God , the Law that came four hundred and thirty years afterward does not annul , so as to defeat the promise .",
    "48 003 018\tFor if the inheritance is by law , it is no longer by promise . But God granted it to Abraham by promise .",
    "48 003 019\tWhy then was the Law ? It was added later to make transgressions , until the Offspring should come to whom the promise had been made , and it was arranged through angels by the hand of a mediator .",
    "48 003 020\tA mediator does not belong to one person , but God is one .",
    "48 003 021\tIs the Law then against the promises of God ? Never ! For if a law had been given which could give life , then really righteousness would have come by law .",
    "48 003 022\tBut the Scripture has shut up all under sin that the promise based on faith in Jesus Christ may be given to those who have faith .",
    "48 003 023\tBefore faith came we were guarded under law , shut up waiting for the faith that was to be revealed .",
    "48 003 024\tThus the Law became our tutor leading us to Christ , that we might be declared righteous by faith .",
    "48 003 025\tNow that faith has come , we are no longer under a tutor .",
    "48 003 026\tYou are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus .",
    "48 003 027\tAll who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ .",
    "48 003 028\tThere cannot be Jew or Greek , slave or free , male or female : for you all are one in Christ Jesus .",
    "48 003 029\tIf you are Christ's , then you are Abraham's offspring and heirs according to the promise .",
    "48 004 001\tI SAY that as long as the heir is under age he differs in nothing from a slave , though he be owner of all .",
    "48 004 002\tBut he is under guardians and managers until the day appointed by the father .",
    "48 004 003\tSo we , when we were under age , were enslaved under the elementary lessons of the world ;",
    "48 004 004\tbut , when the fullness of time came , God sent forth his Son born of a woman , born under the Law ,",
    "48 004 005\tthat he might redeem those who were under Law , that we might receive the recognition as sons .",
    "48 004 006\tBecause you are sons , God has sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son crying Abba , Father .",
    "48 004 007\tSo you are no longer a slave , but a son , and if a son , then also an heir , through God's act .",

    "50 003 015\tLet us all who are full grown think in this way . If in anything you think differently , even that God will reveal to you ,",
    "50 003 016\tbut so far as we have attained let us walk in the same path .",
    "50 003 017\tUnite in imitating me , brethren , and watch those who are living according to our example .",

    "50 004 002\tI beg Euodia and I beg Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord .",
    "50 004 003\tYes , I ask you , true yokefellow , help them , since they struggled in spreading the good news along with me and Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life .",
    "50 004 004\tRejoice in the Lord always . Again I say rejoice .",
    "50 004 005\tLet your fairness be known to all men . The Lord is near .",
    "50 004 006\tDo not worry , but in everything by prayer and entreaty with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God .",

    "52 002 014\tFor you became imitators , brethren , of the churches of God that are in Judaea in Christ Jesus , because you too suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen that they did from the Jews ,",

    "52 003 001\tSO when we could no longer endure the anxiety , we chose to be left at Athens alone",

    "52 003 003\tthat no one might be disturbed in these trials . For you yourselves know that we are destined to this .",

    "52 003 011\tMay our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus Christ open the way for us to come to you .",
    "52 003 012\tThe Lord make you to abound and overflow in love toward one another and toward all men , just as we do toward you ,",

    "52 004 001\tTO conclude , brethren , we beg of you and urge you in the Lord Jesus that , as you learned from us how you ought to live to please God , and are living , you will excel still more .",
    "52 004 002\tFor you know what directions we have given you through the Lord Jesus .",
    "52 004 003\tFor this is the will of God : to have you become holy and have you shun unchastity ;",
    "52 004 004\tto have each of you know how to take a wife for himself in holiness and honor ,",
    "52 004 005\tnot in the passion of lust , as the Gentiles do who know not God ;",
    "52 004 006\tto have no one trespass or take advantage of his brother in this matter ; for the Lord is the punisher of all such , as we have already told you and solemnly warned you .",
    "52 004 007\tGod has not called us to live in impurity , but in holiness .",
    "52 004 008\tTherefore he who disregards this disregards not man , but God , who gives his Holy Spirit to you .",
    "52 004 009\tRegarding brotherly love you have no need for me to write to you . For you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another ,",
    "52 004 010\tand you do the same to all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia . But we urge you , brethren , to excel still further",
    "52 004 011\tand to be ambitious to lead a quiet life and to mind each his own business and to work with your hands , as we instructed you .",
    "52 004 012\tThus you will live becomingly in the sight of outsiders and will have need of nothing .",
    "52 004 013\tWe do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , regarding those who are sleeping , that you may not sorrow as the rest of men who have no hope .",
    "52 004 014\tFor since , as we believe , Jesus died and rose , so too God will through Jesus bring with him those who have fallen asleep .",
    "52 004 015\tThis we tell you by the word of the Lord : We , the living , who have been left until the coming of the Lord , will not have the start of those who have fallen asleep .",
    "52 004 016\tFor the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of an archangel and with God's trumpet-call , and first the dead in Christ will rise .",
    "52 004 017\tThen we , the living , who are left , will be caught up along with them into the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And thus we shall forever be with the Lord .",
    "52 004 018\tSo encourage one another with these words .",
    "52 005 001\tBUT regarding times and dates , brethren , you do not need to have me write to you .",
    "52 005 002\tFor you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night .",
    "52 005 003\tWhen they are saying , \" Peace and safety , \" then sudden destruction is upon them , like the pangs upon a woman with child , and they will not escape .",
    "52 005 004\tBut you , brethren , are not in darkness so that the day can take you like a thief .",
    "52 005 005\tYou are all sons of light and sons of day . We do not belong to night or to darkness .",
    "52 005 006\tThen let us not be sleeping like the rest of men , but let us watch and be sober .",
    "52 005 007\tFor those who sleep sleep in the night and those who drink drink in the night .",
    "52 005 008\tBut let us who are of the day be sober . Let us put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation .",
    "52 005 009\tFor God has not destined us to wrath , but to the winning of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,",
    "52 005 010\twho died for us that whether we are waking or sleeping we may live in company with him .",
    "52 005 011\tTherefore encourage one another and build up one another , as indeed you are doing .",
    "52 005 012\tWe beg you , brethren , to regard those who are laboring among you and who preside over you in the Lord and give you counsel ,",
    "52 005 013\tand to esteem them very highly in love on account of their work . Be at peace among yourselves .",
    "52 005 014\tWe urge you , brethren , to warn the disorderly , encourage the faint-hearted , help the weak , be patient with all .",

    "58 002 001\tFOR this reason we should give special attention to the things that we have heard , so as not to drift away from them .",
    "58 002 002\tFor if the message spoken through angels was sure and every violation and disobedience received merited punishment ,",
    "58 002 003\thow shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation , which at the beginning was spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him ,",

    "58 002 005\tFor he has not subjected to angels the coming world of which we speak .",
    "58 002 006\tBut somewhere one says , \" What is man that thou rememberest him ? Or the son of man that thou carest for him ?",

    "58 002 016\tFor he does not come to the help of angels , but he comes to the help of the descendants of Abraham .",

    "58 003 018\tTo whom did he swear that they should not enter his rest , except to those who had no faith ?",
    "58 003 019\tWe see that they were unable to enter because of their lack of faith .",
    "58 004 001\tLET us , then , be afraid that , though the promise of entering his rest is still left , some one of you may seem to have missed it .",
    "58 004 002\tFor we have received the good news just as they did , but the message that was heard did not benefit them , since it did not meet with faith in the hearers .",
    "58 004 003\tFor we who have faith are entering into the rest , as he said , \" As I swore in my wrath , ' They shall not enter into my rest , ' \" although his works had been finished since the creation of the world .",
    "58 004 004\tFor he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day thus , \" And God rested on the seventh day from all his works , \"",
    "58 004 005\tand in this place again , \" They shall not enter into my rest . \"",
    "58 004 006\tSince , then , it remains for some to enter into it , and those who first received the good news did not enter because of lack of faith â",
    "58 004 007\tagain he indicates a day , \" to-day , \" saying in David so long after , as has been already quoted , \" To-day if you will hear his voice , do not harden your hearts . \"",
    "58 004 008\tFor if Joshua had given them rest he would not be speaking of another day after that .",
    "58 004 009\tTherefore there still remains a rest for the people of God .",
    "58 004 010\tFor he who has entered into God's rest has rested from his works as God did from his .",
    "58 004 011\tLet us endeavor then to enter into that rest so that no one shall fall , after that example of lack of faith .",
    "58 004 012\tFor the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any two-edged sword , and it pierces until it divides soul and spirit , joints and marrow , and it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart .",
    "58 004 013\tThere is not a creature invisible to him , but all things are naked and defenseless before the eyes of him to whom we must account .",
    "58 004 014\tSince , then , we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold fast our confession .",
    "58 004 015\tFor we have not a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses , for he has been tempted in every way just as we are , yet without sin .",
    "58 004 016\tTherefore let us come with confidence to the throne of grace and receive compassion and find grace for timely help .",
    "58 005 001\tFOR every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things relating to God to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins .",
    "58 005 002\tHe is able to sympathize with the ignorant and the erring , since he himself is beset with weaknesses .",
    "58 005 003\tFor this reason he must bring an offering for his own sins , just as he does for those of the people .",
    "58 005 004\tAnd no one takes this honor upon himself unless called by God , as Aaron was .",
    "58 005 005\tSo too Christ did not take for himself the glory of becoming a high priest , but he who said to him , \" Thou art my Son , to-day I have become thy Father , \"",
    "58 005 006\tand who says in another place , \" Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek . \"",
    "58 005 007\tChrist , in the days of his flesh , offered prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death , with strong outcries and tears , and was heard and saved from his terrors .",
    "58 005 008\tAlthough he was a Son he learned obedience from his sufferings ,",
    "58 005 009\tand being thus made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him ,",
    "58 005 010\tand was proclaimed by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek .",
    "58 005 011\tRegarding Melchizedek we have much to say that is hard to explain , since you have become dull of hearing .",
    "58 005 012\tFor when , considering the time , you ought to be teachers you need to have some one teach you again the first principles of the revelations of God . You have come to need milk and not solid food .",
    "58 005 013\tFor every one who takes milk is inexperienced in the doctrine of righteousness , for he is a child .",
    "58 005 014\tBut solid food is for adults who through practice have their senses exercised in distinguishing good and bad .",
    "58 006 001\tTHEREFORE let us leave elementary teaching about Christ and hasten on to what is advanced , not laying again a foundation â change of heart from dead works , faith in God ,",
    "58 006 002\tthe teaching about baptisms , the laying on of hands , resurrection of the dead , and eternal judgment .",
    "58 006 003\tThis we will do if God permits .",
    "58 006 004\tFor it is impossible for those who have been once for all enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers in the Holy Spirit",
    "58 006 005\tand have tasted God's word and the powers of the coming world ,",
    "58 006 006\tand then have fallen away , to have again a change of heart , since they are crucifying for themselves afresh the Son of God and putting him to open shame .",
    "58 006 007\tFor ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it and bears plants useful to those for whom it is farmed shares in God's blessing ;",
    "58 006 008\tbut if it bears thorns and thistles it is judged worthless and is near to being cursed . In the end it will be burnt over .",
    "58 006 009\tBut we are persuaded of better things regarding you , beloved , things that belong with salvation , though we thus speak .",
    "58 006 010\tFor God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love that you have shown to his name as you have served and are still serving the holy .",
    "58 006 011\tBut we desire to have each one of you show to the end the same earnestness for the fulfillment of our hope ,",
    "58 006 012\tthat you may not be dull , but imitators of those who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises .",
    "58 006 013\tFor God , when making the promise to Abraham , since he could swear by no one greater , swore by himself ,",
    "58 006 014\tsaying , \" Surely , I will greatly bless you and greatly multiply you . \"",
    "58 006 015\tAnd so after patient waiting Abraham obtained what was promised .",
    "58 006 016\tFor men swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them the end of all dispute .",
    "58 006 017\tIn this case God being abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable purpose of his will gave the surety of an oath ,",
    "58 006 018\tthat by two unchangeable things , in which it was impossible for God to be false , we might have strong encouragement , we who have fled to lay hold on the hope that lies before us .",
    "58 006 019\tWe have this hope as an anchor of the soul , sure and firm , and it enters into the tent within the curtain",
    "58 006 020\twhere Jesus , our forerunner , has entered in our behalf , becoming forever a high priest after the order of Melchizedek .",
    "58 007 001\tFOR , this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of God Most High , who met Abraham when he was returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him ,",
    "58 007 002\tand to whom Abraham gave a tenth of all ,",
    "58 007 003\twithout father , without mother , without ancestors , without either birthday or end of life , but made like the Son of God , remains a priest permanently .",
    "58 007 004\tBut see how great this man was , since Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of his choicest spoils .",
    "58 007 005\tAnd even those of the sons of Levi who attain the priesthood have command according to the Law to take a tenth from the people , their own brethren , although these have sprung from the loins of Abraham .",
    "58 007 006\tBut he who had no genealogy from these took a tenth from Abraham and pronounced a blessing on him who had the promises .",
    "58 007 007\tWithout dispute the less is blessed by the greater .",
    "58 007 008\tAnd here mortal men receive tenths , but there one of whom the witness is that he is living .",
    "58 007 009\tAnd , to put it frankly , Levi , who receives the tenths , was made to pay a tenth through Abraham .",
    "58 007 010\tFor he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met Abraham .",
    "58 007 011\tIf , then , perfection had been through the Levitical priesthood , â for on the basis of that the people received the Law â what need was there for another kind of priest to arise and not be called of the order of Aaron ?",
    "58 007 012\tFor when the priesthood has been changed there comes of necessity also a change of law .",
    "58 007 013\tFor he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe , from which no one has ever had anything to do with the altar .",
    "58 007 014\tFor it is plain that our Lord has arisen from Judah , and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests .",
    "58 007 015\tAnd this is yet more abundantly evident if after the order of Melchizedek there arises a priest of a different kind",
    "58 007 016\twho has become such , not according to the law of a commandment made for the flesh , but according to the power of unending life .",
    "58 007 017\tFor it is affirmed of him , \" Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek . \"",
    "58 007 018\tThere is a setting aside of the earlier commandment because of its weakness and uselessness â",
    "58 007 019\tfor the Law brought nothing to perfection â and there is the bringing in of a better hope through which we draw near to God .",
    "58 007 020\tAnd just as it was not without an oath â",
    "58 007 021\tfor those men have become priests without an oath , but he with an oath from him who said to him , \" The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind : thou art a priest forever \" â",
    "58 007 022\tby so much better is the covenant of which Jesus has become surety .",
    "58 007 023\tAnd many of them became priests because they were prevented by death from continuing ,",
    "58 007 024\tbut he , because he continues forever , has an unending priesthood .",
    "58 007 025\tAnd so he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him , since he is forever living to intercede for them .",
    "58 007 026\tFor such was the High Priest that we needed , holy , innocent , unstained , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens .",
    "58 007 027\tHe has not the daily need , like the other priests , first to offer sacrifices for his own sins and then for those of the people . This latter he did once for all when he offered himself .",
    "58 007 028\tFor the Law makes high priests of men who have infirmities , but the word of the oath , which comes after the Law , makes High Priest of a Son who is perfected forever .",
    "58 008 001\tTHE chief point of what I have been saying is this : we have such a High Priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens ,",
    "58 008 002\tand who ministers in the holy place and in the true Tent set up by the Lord , not by man .",
    "58 008 003\tNow every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices . Whence it is necessary for this one to have something to offer .",
    "58 008 004\tIf he were upon the earth he would not be a priest at all , since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law .",
    "58 008 005\tThey minister as an example and shadow of the things in heaven , just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the Tent . \" See , \" it was said , \" that you make everything according to the model shown you on the mountain . \"",
    "58 008 006\tBut now Christ has obtained a ministry as much more excellent as the covenant of which he is mediator is better and based upon better promises .",
    "58 008 007\tFor if that first covenant had been faultless a place would not have been sought for a second .",
    "58 008 008\tBut finding fault with it he says , \" The days are coming , says the Lord , when I will make for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant ,",

    "58 008 010\tThis is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord ; I will put my laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts and I will be their God and they will be my people .",
    "58 008 011\tThey shall not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother saying , ' Know the Lord ' ; for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest of them ,",

    "58 008 013\tIn saying \" new \" he has pronounced the first covenant old . But what grows old and decadent is near to disappearance .",
    "58 009 001\tTHE first covenant had regulations of worship and its holy building in this world .",
    "58 009 002\tFor a Tent was erected , in the first part of which were the lampstand and the table and the consecrated bread . This was called the Holy Place .",
    "58 009 003\tBehind the second curtain was the part called the Holy of Holies .",
    "58 009 004\tIt had the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant all covered with gold . In this was a golden jar with the manna and Aaron's rod that sprouted and the tablets of the covenant .",
    "58 009 005\tAbove it were cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of propitiation . Regarding these things it is not now possible to speak in detail .",
    "58 009 006\tBut these things being thus arranged , the priests go constantly into the first part of the Tent , performing their services ,",
    "58 009 007\tbut into the second part the High Priest alone goes once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself and for the sins ignorantly committed by the people .",
    "58 009 008\tThe Holy Spirit shows this , that the way into the holy place has not yet been made plain while the first Tent is standing .",
    "58 009 009\tThat is a symbol , for the time being , in accordance with which gifts and sacrifices are offered , though they cannot make the worshiper perfect in his conscience ,",
    "58 009 010\tsince they consist only of foods and drinks and various baths â rules respecting the flesh , imposed until the time of reformation .",
    "58 009 011\tBut when Christ came as High Priest of the good things that have come , he entered once for all through the greater and more perfect Tent not made by hands â that is , not of this creation â",
    "58 009 012\tand not with the blood of goats and calves , but with his own blood , into the holy place , and thereby found eternal redemption .",
    "58 009 013\tFor if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the defiled , makes them holy as regards purity of their flesh ,",
    "58 009 014\thow much more will the blood of Christ , who through an eternal Spirit offered himself an unblemished sacrifice to God , cleanse our consciences from dead works for the service of the living God .",
    "58 009 015\tFor this reason he is the mediator of a better covenant that , a death having taken place for redemption from sins under the first covenant , those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance promised to them .",
    "58 009 016\tFor where there is a last will and testament the death of the testator must be put in evidence .",
    "58 009 017\tFor a will is valid in the case of the dead : it never has any force while the testator is living .",
    "58 009 018\tHence the first covenant was not introduced without blood .",
    "58 009 019\tWhen all the commands of the Law had been spoken by Moses to all the people , he took the blood of calves and goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled it on the book and on all the people ,",
    "58 009 020\tsaying , \" This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded for you . \"",
    "58 009 021\tAnd the Tent and all the things used in worship he likewise sprinkled with blood .",
    "58 009 022\tAlmost everything is cleansed with blood , according to the Law , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .",
    "58 009 023\tIt was necessary , then , that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these sacrifices , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .",
    "58 009 024\tFor Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands , a copy of the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear before the face of God in our behalf .",
    "58 009 025\tNor was it to offer himself often , as the High Priest enters into the holy place every year with blood not his own ;",
    "58 009 026\tthen he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world . But now , once for all , at the end of the ages , he has appeared to do away with sin by his sacrifice .",
    "58 009 027\tAnd as it is appointed for men once for all to die and after this comes judgment ,",
    "58 009 028\tso Christ was once for all offered to bear the sins of many and will appear the second time , apart from sin , to those who are looking for him , and bring them salvation .",
    "58 010 001\tFOR the Law with a shadow of the good things that are coming , but not the very likeness of the things , cannot , by the same sacrifices which they offer constantly every year , ever make perfect those who come ,",
    "58 010 002\tsince would they not have ceased offering them ? Because the worshipers , once for all cleansed , would have had no consciousness of sins .",
    "58 010 003\tBut in the sacrifices these are called to mind every year .",
    "58 010 004\tFor the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take away sins .",
    "58 010 005\tTherefore on coming into the world he says , \" Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire : a body thou hast prepared for me .",
    "58 010 006\tWhole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not delight in .",
    "58 010 007\tThen I said , ' Here I have come â in the roll of the book it is written of me â to do thy will , O God . ' \"",
    "58 010 008\tHe first says , \" Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not desire nor delight in , \" such as are offered according to the Law ,",
    "58 010 009\tand then he says , \" Here I have come to do thy will . \" He takes away the first to establish the second .",
    "58 010 010\tBy this \" will \" we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .",
    "58 010 011\tEvery priest stands daily doing service and offering many times the same sacrifices , although they never can take away sins .",
    "58 010 012\tBut this Priest after offering one sacrifice for sins forever , took his seat at the right hand of God ,",
    "58 010 013\tfor the future only waiting until his enemies are made his footstool .",
    "58 010 014\tFor by one offering he has forever perfected those who are made holy .",
    "58 010 015\tThe Holy Spirit testifies this to us ; for after having said ,",
    "58 010 016\t\" This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , says the Lord : I will put my laws in their hearts and on their minds I will write them , \" he adds ,",
    "58 010 017\t\" and their sins and their law-breakings I will remember no more . \"",
    "58 010 018\tBut where there is forgiveness of these , there is no longer any offering for sin .",
    "58 010 019\tSince we have , then , brethren , confidence in entering the holy place through the blood of Jesus ,",
    "58 010 020\tby the new and living way which he has made for us through the curtain , that is , his flesh ,",
    "58 010 021\tand since we have a great Priest over the house of God ,",
    "58 010 022\tlet us come with true hearts in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies bathed in pure water .",
    "58 010 023\tLet us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering , for he is faithful who has promised ,",

    "58 010 026\tFor if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth , there remains no longer any sacrifice for sins ,",
    "58 010 027\tbut a dreadful expectation of doom and a fury of fire that will devour the opposers .",
    "58 010 028\tAny one who sets aside a law of Moses dies without pity on the testimony of two or three witnesses .",
    "58 010 029\tOf how much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy who has trampled on the Son of God , who has thought the blood of the covenant , by which it was made holy , an unholy thing , and who has insulted the Spirit of grace ?",
